# 👋 Welcome to Israel Gonzalez-Brooks' GitHub

I'm a full-stack software engineer specializing in building scalable, AI-integrated applications using modern stacks like PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). With a background in freelance projects, I focus on creating "Cathedral-Class" projects that demonstrate 400x engineering excellence—robust, innovative, and production-ready.

## About Me
- **Professional Focus:** Architecting end-to-end solutions for complex problems, from AI-driven tools to efficient APIs.
- **Core Values:** Integrity, continuous learning, and delivering high-impact code.
- **Fun Fact:** When not coding, I'm exploring AI ethics or taking a meditative walk.

## Current Mission: Cathedral Projects
I'm building three flagship "Cathedral-Class" portfolio projects to showcase elite engineering:
- **[Scribe-AI](https://github.com/israelgonzalezb/scribe-ai):** An AI-powered transcription and note-taking app leveraging natural language processing.
- **[CodeChronicle](https://github.com/israelgonzalezb/codechronicle):** A developer journal for tracking code evolution and insights with integrated analytics.
- **[API-Deck](https://github.com/israelgonzalezb/api-deck):** A comprehensive API management toolkit for building and deploying robust backends.

These projects are in active development—watch for updates!
